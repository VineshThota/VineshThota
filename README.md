# Hey, I’m Vinesh Thota 👋

I didn’t start my career thinking I’d end up building AI-driven products. It happened gradually. One problem at a time, one messy workflow at a time, one team conversation at a time. Somewhere along the way, I realised I enjoy taking a tangled idea, stripping out the noise, and turning it into something a team can actually build and also turn around into revenue generating business.

That’s pretty much been the theme ever since.

I work in product, and my day usually looks like a mix of understanding what users really mean, translating chaos into structure, and working with engineering to get things shipped without unnecessary drama. The fun part isn’t the launch — it’s the moments when a team gets aligned and everything finally clicks.

## 🧩 What I Spend Most Days Doing

- Drawing a clear path when the initial idea is vague  
- Pairing with engineering to make sure we’re solving the right problem  
- Designing flows that reduce complexity rather than add to it  
- Keeping execution clean, even when priorities shift  
- Breaking big challenges into steps that don’t overwhelm the team

## 🚀 Projects and Work I’m Proud Of

I’ve worked across AI agent setups, automation pipelines, internal tools, and end-to-end product cycles. Some of the work is private, but the thinking behind it shows up in my repos. They’re less about fancy visuals and more about clear structure and practical approach — which is where I usually operate best.

## 🌱 What I’m Exploring These Days

- Cleaner and more practical patterns for agentic systems  
- Better collaboration rhythms between product and engineering  
- How to keep complexity under control as teams scale their AI work

# Hey, I’m Vinesh Thota 👋

My career has been shaped by curiosity and that curiosity naturally pulled me into the world of AI-driven products. What started as solving small, messy problems slowly turned into a passion for untangling complex ideas and turning them into something real, useful, and buildable.

Along the way, I discovered how much I enjoy stripping away noise, bringing clarity to teams, and shaping concepts that can grow into revenue-generating products.

Today, I work in product, and my days are a mix of understanding what users actually need, bringing structure to chaos, and working closely with engineering to ship things with high motivation. The launch is great, but the real joy comes from that moment when a team aligns, the pieces fall into place, and the whole thing suddenly makes sense.

## 🧩 What I Spend Most Days Doing

- Drawing a clear path when the initial idea is vague  
- Pairing with engineering to make sure we’re solving the right problem  
- Designing flows that reduce complexity rather than add to it  
- Keeping execution clean, even when priorities shift  
- Breaking big challenges into steps that don’t overwhelm the team

## 🚀 Projects and Work I’m Proud Of

I’ve worked across AI agent setups, automation pipelines, internal tools, and end-to-end product cycles. Some of the work is private, but the thinking behind it shows up in my repos. They’re less about fancy visuals and more about clear structure and practical approach — which is where I usually operate best.

## 🌱 What I’m Exploring These Days

- Cleaner and more practical patterns for agentic systems  
- Better collaboration rhythms between product and engineering  
- How to keep complexity under control as teams scale their AI work
